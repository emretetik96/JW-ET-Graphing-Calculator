This program is functional graphing calculator which not only displays the graph of the inputed equation but also allows you to calculate x and y intercepts and asymptotes.

To run the program, type:
	
	sh build.sh

Valid Operators and inputs for graphing calculator: {".", "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "+", "-", "*", "/", "^", "x", "e", "pi", "sin", "cos", "tan", "cot", "csc", "sec", "log", "ln"};

1.To graph a function first type in desired equation in the form y = f(x) and press the enter key.
2. If the function is a valid readable function press the graph key in the top right corner
3. To obtain the x-intercepts, y-intercepts, and asymptotes for this function press the appropriate button. 
4. To change the dimensions of the viewing screen, change the values in the appropriate boxes at the bottom of the screen and press enter for each change.

Note: In order to obtain an accurate picture of your graph in relation to the x and y axes, you must use a square viewing window, with the origin at the center.
